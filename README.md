# 🦀 minikv

**A distributed, multi-tenant key-value & object store written in Rust**

minikv provides strong consistency (Raft + 2PC), durability (WAL), and production-grade observability, security, and multi-tenancy — all in a modern Rust codebase.

Built in public as a learning-by-doing project — now evolved into a complete, reference implementation of distributed systems in Rust.

## 🚦 What's New in v0.8.0

minikv v0.8.0 brings enterprise-grade features for distributed deployments:

- **Cross-datacenter replication:** Async replication with multiple conflict resolution strategies (LWW, Vector Clocks)
- **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Real-time event streaming to Webhook, Kafka, or file sinks
- **Admin Web UI:** Embedded dashboard for cluster monitoring and management
- **Backup & Restore:** Full and incremental backups with encryption support
- **Plugin system:** Extensible architecture for custom storage, auth, and hooks

Previous highlights (v0.7.0): secondary indexes, multi-key transactions, batch import/export, durable S3 backend.

## 🤔 What is minikv?

minikv is a distributed key-value store written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), designed for simplicity, speed, and reliability.

**Who is this for ?**  
minikv is for engineers learning distributed systems, teams experimenting with Rust-based infrastructure, and anyone curious about consensus, durability, and system trade-offs.

- **Clustered :** Raft consensus and 2PC for transactional writes
- **Virtual Sharding :** 256 vshards for elastic scaling & balancing
- **WAL :** Write-ahead log for durability
- **gRPC** for node communication, **HTTP REST & S3 API** for clients
- **Bloom filters, snapshots, watch/subscribe** for performance & reactivity

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Rust** – core logic
- **Shell** – orchestration/automation
- **JavaScript** – benchmarks, tools
- **Makefile** – build flows

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whispem/minikv.git
cd minikv
cargo build --release

# Start a node
cargo run -- --config config.example.toml

# API examples
curl localhost:8080/health/ready   # readiness
curl localhost:8080/metrics        # Prometheus metrics
curl localhost:8080/admin/status   # admin dashboard

# Create API key (admin)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/admin/keys -d '{"role":"ReadWrite","tenant_id":"acme"}'

# S3 (demo)
curl -X PUT localhost:8080/s3/mybucket/mykey -d 'hello minikv!'
curl localhost:8080/s3/mybucket/mykey
```
For cluster setup and advanced options, see the [documentation](#documentation).

## 📐 Architecture

- **Raft**: consensus and leader election
- **2PC**: atomic distributed/batch writes
- **Virtual Shards**: scale and rebalance across 256 partitions
- **Pluggable Storage**: in-memory, RocksDB, Sled
- **Admin API**: HTTP endpoints for status, metrics and config
- **Config**: via environment, file or CLI flags

---

## 🚀 Performance

- Write throughput : over 50,000 operations/sec (single node, in-memory)
- Sub-millisecond read latency
- Cluster tested (3–5 nodes, commodity VMs)
- Built-in Prometheus metrics

---

## 🌟 Features

### Distributed Core
- Raft consensus (multi-node, strong consistency)
- Two-phase commit (2PC) for atomic multi-key transactions
- 256 virtual shards for cluster scaling and rebalancing
- Write-ahead log (WAL) for durability
- Auto-rebalancing, graceful leader failover, hot-join and node removal

### Data Management
- Time-To-Live keys (TTL)
- LZ4 compression (configurable)
- Bloom filters and index snapshots
- Pluggable and persistent storage: in-memory, RocksDB, Sled
- Batch & range operations, prefix queries

### API
- HTTP REST (CRUD, batch, range, admin)
- S3-compatible API (with TTL extensions)
- gRPC (internal)
- WebSocket and SSE endpoints for real-time watch/subscribe events

### Security & Multi-tenancy
- API keys (Argon2) and JWT authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC) and audit logging
- Multi-tenant isolation
- AES-256-GCM encryption at rest
- Per-tenant quotas (storage, requests, rate limits)
- TLS (HTTP & gRPC)

### Observability
- Admin dashboard
- Prometheus metrics (counters, histograms)
- Request and endpoint statistics
- Structured logging and tracing spans
- Kubernetes health probes

### Production-grade Design
- Memory-safe Rust
- Test suite, automated CI
- Documentation and sample config
- Single static binary

## 📖 Story

minikv started as a 24-hour challenge by a Rust learner (82 days into the language!). It now serves as both a playground and a reference for distributed systems, demonstrating curiosity, learning-by-doing, and robust engineering.

## 📚 Documentation

- **Example config :** [`config.example.toml`](config.example.toml)
- **Cluster, API, usage :** see [`docs/`](docs)
- **Certificate generation :** [`certs/README.md`](certs/README.md)

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
cargo test           # Run all tests
cargo clippy --fix   # Lint and fix
cargo fmt            # Format code
```

Continuous Integration runs on push & PR via [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
